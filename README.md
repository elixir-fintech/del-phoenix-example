# DelExample

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS

You need the [Double Entry Ledger](https://github.com/elixir-fintech/double_entry_ledger) to be installed on the same directory level
and follow the steps in the repositories `README.md` to move the migration files over and create the tables in the DB.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
